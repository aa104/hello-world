# hello-world
test repository
Hi,  
    I'm going through GitHub, learning how to use it.
    I have created a repository, which automatically comes with a master. 
    I have alsoe created a branch, which I can make changes of the master (at a ceratin point in time).
    Finally, I am now learning how to make notes of the changes made to the branch.
